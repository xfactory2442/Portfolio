            In this project I created a turn/grid based game where the player has to move
            across the grid, talking to the blue npcs and completing quests for them. <br />
            This game is a proof of concept and therefore is lacking mechanics and not very
            fun to play. <br />
            This was a solo project and was made using
            <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>.<br />

            <br />
            The blue area around the player is generated using the A* algorithm which will
            find which squares the player can move to. Then, if the player clicks within
            this blue area the player will move to that spot on the grid. <br />
            The blue squares with numbers on them are NPC and they will generate quests on
            their turn. These quests are generated based on 2 parameters: a set of needs
            and a set of relationships. <br />
            The NPC's needs are a list of some of the resources in
            the game which are then randomly given a number between 0 and 9 at the start of the
            game. This number is then increased on the NPCs turn. The closer to 9 the number is
            the more likely that resource will be included in any quests the NPC generates.
            Completing a quest should lower the included needs numbers to show that the
            need has been taken care of. <br />
            The NPC holds relationships between itself and the other NPCs. The NPC's relationship
            with the player determines how hard the quests that NPC generates will be.
            The more the NPC likes the player (the closer the number is to 9), the less
            resources they will ask for.

            In this project I made a basic card game where the player plays their
            cards then the enemy will hit the player on their turn. The player
            has to press R on their keyboard to end their turn. This is a left over
            from when it meant R for Reset Hand and I never changed it.<br />

            This project is the first time I'm messing around with HTML/JavaScript. The game is a
            very early version of an incremental/idle game cause those work well for what I
            was trying to learn. <br />
            The player starts out with one button to press and two
            tabs and as they play the game they unlock more options for buttons. <br />
            The player can also change the colour of all of the buttons which I added
            1) because of colour blind people who might look at it and 2) because I wanted
            to figure out how to change the style of something using JavaScript.

            Throught a third year module we were taught many terrian generation techniques
            which we were then to collate together for the final submission.
            This is the final submission for that module.<br />
            <br />
            This project includes: <br />
            - Procedural generation of trees. <br />
            - Generating a random height field for the terrain which can then be used with
            other techniques to create an interesting terrain. <br />
            - Faulting the terrian to create different layered area. <br />
            - Using the diamond-square algorithm. <br />
            - Using perlin noise to smooth out terrains. <br />
            - Using Voronoi Regeions to split the terrian into sections. This has not been
            used in this project to make interesting terrains but could be used in the future
            to split a terrain into pieces and use different techniques on each part for a
            more varied terrain. <br />
            <br />
            This was a solo project and was made using a framework for DirectX given
            to students to use.

            I made this game as a passion project. I wanted to try making a game
            which would gradually unlock new mechanics and tabs as you played.
            I was very into incremental games at the time so based the game off
            those kinds of mechanics. <br />
            <br />
            In this game you are a blob newly created in this world. You have 
            three time slots to fill (morning, afternoon, evening) and 
            when you assign a timeslot a task, the blob will do that
            task in that timeslot when the day progresses. The blob begins by
            only being able to think but they gain more actions later in the game.
            When the blob dies, the next blob will inherit some knowlege of
            how to do the actions commited in that run which will increase the 
            blobs progress when completing those actions. <br />
            <br />
            The game in its current state is unfinished and may contain bugs. <br />
